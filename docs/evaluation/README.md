# Study Design

## Research Objective

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the functional suitability and usability of the ADR Manager, a tool to support the creation and editing of ADRs. By involving software professionals who have experience with ADRs, we hope to gain insights from the practical usage of the tool.

## Research Question

- How do software professionals perceive the functional suitability of the ADR Manager?
- How do software professionals perceive the usability of the ADR Manager?
- Which improvements do software professionals suggest for the ADR Manager?

## Research Process

### Context

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ADR Manager, a web-based tool to manage and edit ADRs on GitHub. The tool was created by undergraduate students in the context of a research project at the University of Stuttgart. The tool was also submitted to the ICSE score 2021 contest. Results will be published on GitHub. Aggregated results will also be published in the final submission for the research project and, if the tool gets selected as semi-finalist at ICSE score, results will also be published in the final submission.is?

### Study Process 

Participants will be notified about the study and will be sent the material. The study is split into two parts: First, the participant will use the tool to solve a small written task while thinking aloud. Second, there will be a short interview about the experience. Study time is estimated between 30 to 45 minutes. 

### Data Collection

During the entire study, the screen of the participant and audio is recorded. 
The recording will be summarised into a written case description to document the most important statements and observations.
The written case description will be sent back to the participant for his/her final approval. This is the last chance to remove or redact statements from the study. After that, the recording will be destroyed and the potentially redacted and approved case description will be the sole base for our qualitative content analysis.

### Data Analysis

Quantitative Results will be aggregated to give an overview of the impression of the participants.

Free-text feedback will be summarised with respect to these categories:

* Functional suitability
    * Functionality that needs improvement 
    * Suggested additional functionality
* Usability
    * Overall satisfaction
    * Intuitive GUI elements
    * Confusing GUI elements
    * Suggested GUI changes
    * Feedback to modes

The categories may be adapted after the study based on the collected data.
