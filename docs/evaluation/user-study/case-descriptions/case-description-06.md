## Interview

### Functional Suitability

**Which provided functionality needs to be improved?**

* It was not intuitive that you don't have to write Markdown in basic mode.

**Which additional functionality would you need to consider using the tool in your professional work?**

* Images for architecture diagrams, e.g. pictures in the repository.
* Status tracking
  * Who made the first proposal?
  * What changes were made?
  * When was the individual status changed?
  * Who accepted it?

### Usability

**How understandable was the user interface for you?**

* Basic and advanced mode were confusing at the start. 
* Considered option fields were confusing.
* Differences between advanced and professional were not clear. Professional would be enough.
* It was not directly clear what was meant by "Deciders".

**How efficiently usable was the user interface for you?**

* Efficient to use. The drag and drop in the considered options supports this. 
* It was intuitively usable.

**Which mode would you use most often?**

* The participant would directly take the mode that can do the most, since a meeting usually contains all the information that is being requested there.

#### Would you switch between modes?

* No.

Additional comments:

- Missing support for images for completeness
- If it was integrated in Azure DevOps, then yes, else no.
