## Interview

### Functional Suitability

**Which provided functionality needs to be improved?**

* Needed functionality is there.

**Which additional functionality would you need to consider using the tool in your professional work?**

* Voting Tool: In practice, the participant's team often votes on which option is chosen. Thus, the participant suggests to add a link to an online voting tool or integrate one.

### Usability

**How understandable was the user interface for you?**

* Understandable because participant knew the template. Otherwise, they may have needed more explanations of text fields.
* `Commit and Push` button was hard to find.
* It was not clear that, when pressing the `Accept` button in the `Convert` tab, information (that does not respect the format of MADR) is deleted.

**How efficiently usable was the user interface for you?**

* The tool is pretty efficiently usable.
* Raw Markdown may be easier.
* Having a structure is nice.

**Which mode would you use most often?**

* Professional mode.

#### Would you switch between modes?

* No.

Additional comments:

- Difference between `Advanced`and `Professional` mode was not clear.
- In practice, the participant can't use the tool because they use Confluence. If they used GitHub and MADR, they would use the tool.
