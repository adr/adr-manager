# Callout for Participation

Hello! We are three motivated students planning to perform a study to evaluate a web-based tool. During our research project at the University of Stuttgart, which was supervised by Oliver Kopp and Justus Bogner, we built a tool to manage and edit Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) on GitHub. [ADRs](1) are a simple format to document decisions made during the development of a software project. Our tool uses [MADR](2), which is a markdown template for ADRs.
We are looking for software professionals to test our tool and give feedback on the practical usage.

All materials for the study are provided in English. For the study itself, the participant can choose between German or English.

Please sign up at <https://terminplaner.dfn.de/adr-manager-study> for a 45 to 60min study.
You do not need to prepare anyhting on your side.
Your email adress won't be published, however, your name will appear at that DFN page.
Thus, choose a pseudonym if you like.

## Purpose of this Study

The ADR Manager is a web-based tool to create and edit Markdown-based ADRs [MADRs](2) on GitHub.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the functional suitability and usability of the ADR Manager to support the creation and editing of ADRs. By involving software professionals who have experience with ADRs, we hope to gain insights to further improve the tool.

The goal of this study is _**NOT**_ to evaluate the abilities of participants.

## Study Process and Analysis

Participants will be notified about the study and will be sent the material.
The study is split into two parts:
First, the participant will use the tool to solve a small written task while thinking aloud.
Second, there will be a short interview about the experience.
Study time is estimated between 30 to 50 minutes.
We kindly ask your permission to record the screen and audio during the entire study for transcription.
The written transcript will be sent back to the participant for his/her final approval.
This is the last chance to remove or redact statements from the study.
After that, the recording will be destroyed and the potentially redacted and approved transcript will be the sole base for our qualitative content analysis.

## Privacy Policy

Participation is strictly voluntary and participants can abort the study at any time without a reason.
Everything that is said in the study is treated as strictly confidential and will not be disclosed to anyone outside our research team without the participantâ€™s permission. Results are aggregated and anonymized before publication. In no way can individual statements be traced back to a participant or company. After the study, participants also have the possibility to exclude or redact statements before the analysis.
Anonymized, redacted and approved case descriptions as well as the analysis will be made publicly available on GitHub. This study is part of a research project at the University of Stuttgart. Results might also be included in the final submission for [ICSE SCORE 2021](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2021/score-2021).
During the study, participants will use a GitHub test account created by us. ADRs created by participants will be deleted immediately after the study. 
The video recordings and unapproved case descriptions will _**NOT**_ be published and will be deleted until April 30, 2021.


We would be very happy about your participation!
If you have any questions, feel free to contact us.
